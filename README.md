# Guide to Templates in C++

## What is this?

This is a guide to templates in C++, specifically the C++17 standard. I intend this to be a detailed, comprehensive guide to templates, but since this is a one man person project (which is being completed so that I can learn about templates) there will undoubtedly be things that I don’t cover. However, this guide should cover most things about templates, especially the basic information about templates.

## Resources used

The three main resources used in the creation of this guide are cppreference.com, learncpp.com, and the Draft Initial Standard (DIS) of the C++17 specification. I use the DIS instead of the official standard because it’s free and the official standard is supposed to be the DIS with some small editorial changes. An archive of the DIS can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170325025026/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4660.pdf). Other sources like stackoverflow.com sparingly.

## Different files and reading order

The .cpp files are essentially the first draft of the sections, used to mess around with the code. The markdown files are more polished, and should be easier to read. Though there shouldn't be much of a difference between the files, if there are any discrepancies the markdown file should be more accurate.

Currently, the sections should be read in this order:

1. Introduction to Templates
2. Function, Alias, and Variable Templates
3. Class Templates and Dependent Names
4. Template Specialization
