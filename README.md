# Guide to Templates in C++

## What is this?

This is a guide to templates in C++, specifically the C++17 standard. I intend the completed product to be a detailed, comprehensive guide to templates.

## Resources used

The three main resources used in the creation of this guide are cppreference.com, learncpp.com, and the Draft Initial Standard (DIS) of the C++17 specification. I use the DIS instead of the official standard because itâ€™s free and the official standard is supposed to be the DIS with some small editorial changes. An archive of the DIS can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170325025026/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4660.pdf). Other sources like stackoverflow.com were used sparingly.

## Different files and reading order

The .cpp files are essentially the first draft of the sections, used to mess around with the code. The markdown files are more polished, and should be easier to read. Though there shouldn't be much of a difference between the files, if there are any discrepancies the markdown file will be the more correct version.

Currently, the sections should be read in this order:

1. Introduction to Templates
2. Function, Alias, and Variable Templates
3. Class Templates and Dependent Names
4. Template Specialization
5. Parameter Packs
6. Forwarding
